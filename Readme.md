# WinDigits

Simplify `Win+<digit>` key combination by displaying hints in taskbar.

## What?

Windows allows you to quickly switch between applications by holding down Windows key and pressing the digit corresponding to the application number on taskbar (e.g. `Win+1` will switch you to the application that appears first in taskbar).

Unfortunately, taskbar buttons are dynamic (unless pinned) and Windows does not provide any hints on which number corresponds to which button.
WinDigits aims to fix that by displaying button numbers any time you hold down your Windows key.
